# Take Their Advice API

## Disclaimer

Written in Rust so I can learn the language. Probably not the greatest Rust codebase.

## Project 2 Phase 1

- Init project, get somewhat familiar with the language
- Setup an API route for frontend
- Make GET requests to Twitter API
- Make NLP sentiment request

# Project 2 Phase 2

- Create a WebSocket server
- Error handling of Twitter & NLP server
- Allow WebSocket clients to stream tweets from a particular user of their choice
- Run sentiment on the tweets as the arrive (bulking should be done in the future)
