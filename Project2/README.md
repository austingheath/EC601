- Companies and enthusiates can build apps on top of the Take Their Advice API. The API streams tweets and sentiment in periodic intervals to a subscribing client. Using this feature, the work described in the initial can be completed by building a client (like a web app).
- As a investing guru and software engineer, I want an API to provide me with real-time tweets and sentiment of those tweets over a period of time for a specific user so I can build an investment app based on this data.
